## Contributing
Guidelines for contributing are currently informal and will likely be refined as development proceeds. Contributions should generally follow the typical "Fork and Pull" process, outlined below:

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
